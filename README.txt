This is a natural-style PyGame number-guessing game! 
It responds to the user's guesses.

Featuring a green-and-brown natural aesthetic, with leaves drifting lazily in gentle circles; 
guess numbers from 1 to 100 with eight attempts.

Guess too high and the number turns red; guess too low and it turns blue.
Get it right and colourful fireworks burst forth!

Press space to restart after each round. 
It's like solving puzzles in the forest â€“ relaxing and delightful!
